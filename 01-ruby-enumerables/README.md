# Ruby Enumerables & Pry

## Prerequisites // Questions
- DataTypes: booleans (bools - truthy/falsey), hashes, strings, integers, arrays, float, nil, symbols,
- Conditionals: if/elsif/else/end, case/when/end, until, do/while,. || && < > == ! !! (js in particular ===)
- Loops: until, do/while, for, each, map, times and all ze methods that us loop over arrays and thangs! 
- Arrays vs Hashes
- Accessing Arrays & Accessing Hashes
- Iterating through Arrays and Hashes using `.each`

## Agenda
Command Line Application (CLI)

- Mindset: building your toolbox. which tool is best for each situation? 
- Enumerables
    - .each
    - .map && .collect ====> going from an array of hashes to an array of strings for instance ( option 1 ) 
    - .filter && .select && .find_all
    - .find && .detect
    - the *block parameter* needs to be logically & descriptively named!!! (the thing btwn the pipes)
- Pry
- Show where this code lives on github and how to access it! 


## Icebox / Addtnl Practice
- make it all domesticated animals instead of finding just dogs (so dogs, cats, fish)
- recursion is so beautiful!!!!!! (rabbit hole of doom/joy?)
