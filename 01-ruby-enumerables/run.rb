# 1. I am building a Pets application. I need to a way to hold all the information (name, type) about a SPECIFIC pet. Which datatype should I use?
# 2. Now, I need a way to hold a list of all of the pets in my app. Which datatype should I use? 
# 3. I want a list of only the names of each pet. How do I do that? What datatype should be returned?
# 4. I want to be to find all pets that are dogs. What iterator should I use? What datatype should be returned?
# 5. I want to be able to find a single animal with a specific name. How do I do that? What datatype should be returned?
